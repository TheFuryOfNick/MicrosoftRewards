# MicrosoftRewards Project
This is a collection of scripts that automate the various tasks for gathering Microsoft Rewards points.

Each can be run individually with npm run commands, or all together with `npm run all`.

## Current Scripts
### EdgeSearcher.js
This tool automates desktop and mobile Edge searches, with a customizable number of searches to be run on randomized character strings.

#### Commands
`npm run desktop-searches` and `npm run mobile-searches`

### DailyRewardLinksClicker.js
This tool opens the Rewards page and clicks the rewards link tiles to open each one and claim the points.

#### Commands
`npm run rewards-links`

### DailyRewardQuizRunner.js
TODO: This is perhaps better as an enhancement to the LinksClicker script, that will open Quiz links and complete them by attempting to click all answer panels

### DailyRewardPollTaker.js
TODO: This is perhaps better an an enhancement to the LinksClicker script, that will open Poll links and click one of the two options to complete the poll
